### Wrapping up
We have covered  
+ Arrays  
+ Slices  
    + The various ways to make them  
    + How they have a fixed capacity but you can create new slices from old ones using append
    + How to slice, slices!

+ len to get the length of an array or slice
+ Test coverage tool
+ reflect.DeepEqual and why it's useful but can reduce the type-safety of your code

We've used slices and arrays with integers but they work with any other type too, including arrays/slices themselves. So you can declare a variable of [][]string if you need to.

[Check out the Go blog post on slices](https://blog.golang.org/go-slices-usage-and-internals) for an in-depth look into slices. Try writing more tests to demonstrate what you learn from reading it.

Another handy way to experiment with Go other than writing tests is the Go playground. You can try most things out and you can easily share your code if you need to ask questions. [I have made a go playground with a slice in it for you to experiment with.â€‹](https://play.golang.org/p/ICCWcRGIO68)

[Here is an example](https://play.golang.org/p/bTrRmYfNYCp) of slicing an array and how changing the slice affects the original array; but a "copy" of the slice will not affect the original array. [Another example](https://play.golang.org/p/Poth8JS28sc) of why it's a good idea to make a copy of a slice after slicing a very large slice.
